    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
        Currently working under Professor <a href="bahh723.github.io">Chen-Yu Wei</a> and his PhD student Haolin Liu on RLHF, Process Reward Models for Dense Reward RL. I've also explored preference-based reinforcement learning for control optimization with him in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also worked with Professor Judy Fox in the Summer 2023 at the Biocomplexity Institute, and did a short stint with <a href="https://cral-uva.github.io/">Dr. Rohan Chandra</a> and looked at applying VLM to help robots learn non-verbal social cues.
